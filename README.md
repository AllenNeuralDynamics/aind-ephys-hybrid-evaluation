# Evaluate spike sorting performance on hybrid recordings
## aind-ephys-hybrid-evaluation

Generate hybrid datasets from existing recordings, by injecting known ground truth into the data.

## Description

This capsule generates hybrid ground-truth datasets by combining existing recordings with hybrid ground-truth spikes. The hybrid templates are 
from the [SpikeInterface hybrid template database](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/hybrid_template_library).

## Inputs

The `data/` folder must include the session data and at least one JSON file generated by the [aind-ephys-job-dispatch](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-job-dispatch) capsule is required (1 is recommended).


### Parameters

The `code/run` script takes no parameters.

### Output

The output of this capsule includes
